# Seahorse

Front-end for GnuPG.

Manages passwords and private keys with a GUI.

Chromium uses the Gnome keyring for passwords, so you can manage your website passwords from there.

Firefox does not, and uses its own system: <http://askubuntu.com/questions/49124/how-to-make-firefox-use-the-gnome-keyring-vault-for-password-storage-and-retriev>

On Ubuntu 14.04, Seahorse is the default generically named "Passwords and Keys" application.
