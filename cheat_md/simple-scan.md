# simple-scan

GUI scanner interface.

Very simple to scan once you manage to install the scanner driver.

Usage:

    simple-scan

Then click scan button. The image updates as the scan is made, and you can stop it when you are done before the scanner reached the bottom.

Make sure your scanner supports the definition preferences you set or you will get a connexion error.
