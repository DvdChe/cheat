# FUSE

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace>

A kernel module, that exposes an interface to userspace, so that userspace applications can implement the filesystem.

This is the most convenient approach to creating a new filesystem, as FUSER gets updated with kernel changes but attempts to expose a more stable interface.
