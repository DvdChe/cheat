# Krusader

KDE extra gear <http://extragear.kde.org/>

Best GUI manager out there.

## Dependencies

Don't forget to install Konsole so you get the terminal emulator.

## Features

-   useractions.

    Execute shell scripts with access to template parameters like current directory or selected files.

-   give shortcuts to useractions.

    You can give shortcuts to anything, including user actions!

-   Konsole terminal emulator current directory changes when you change directory in the GUI.

-   FTP. Just enter an FTP URL on the address bar and it all works.

    FileZilla is still better at this I think.

## Important configurations

Some defaults could be better.

-   Ctrl + T and Ctrl + Tab for tab movement to match Firefox and other modern apps.

-   prevent Esc from losing Konsole focus. Esc is important for Vim mode console usage

-   F4 opens in gVim through useraction instead of on the KDE editor.

    Useraction: TODO

-   F2 opens Guake in the current directory when you need a larger shell

    Useraction: TODO

## Warning windows

## Warning windows

When I delete files with `Del` or do other actions, I get an annoying warning popup.
