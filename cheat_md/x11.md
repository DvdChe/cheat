# X11

Real name: X Window System.

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System>

X11 is a window system:

- <http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/20385/windows-managers-vs-login-managers-vs-display-managers-vs-desktop-environment>

It is by far the most commonly used on Linux.

Alternatives: <http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/9608/lightweight-x11-alternative-available>

-   Wayland. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol)

    It is not yet widely used, but plans made for use in Ubuntu 16.04.

    Based on the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EGL_(API) Khronos API.

    Reference implementation: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(display_server_protocol)#Weston>

-   Mir. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mir_(software)

    Part of it comes from the Android API.

X11 is only an interface.

There can be different implementations:

-   X.org implementation currently dominates
-   XFree86 was the dominant prior to 2004, when it adopted BSD license leaving GPL, and fell into oblivion.

X is an abstraction layer for things like:

- windows
- key presses
- mouse position / presses
- screen backlight

X does not:

-   relegates certain jobs to x display managers and X window managers.

-   panel

-   a desktop that shows files contained in some predefined folder. TODO who does that?

-   sound management

    This has been taken up by other projects:

    - PulseAudio
    - Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA)

Usually graphic accelerated. This is why messing with GPU settings may break your desktop.

X11 uses a server/client mode

Client and server can be on different machines

Client:

- typically programs with a window
- clients give commands to the X server and tell it to draw on screen
- clients respond to input events via callback functions

Server:

-   creates the image

-   sends inputs events to clients who responds to it via callbacks

-   a server has many displays

-   a display has many screens, one mouse and one keyboard

-   to set the display to use use the DISPLAY var:

        env DISPLAY=localhost:0.1 firefox & #single commena

    Display notation: `0.1` means: display 0, screen 1

A good way to see some basic and useful application implemented in pure X as demos
is to do `ls /etc/X11/app-defaults`

## xorg

Dominant implementation of the X server.

Configuration file:

    man xorg.conf

First of:

- `/etc/X11/<cmdline>`
- `/tmp/Xorg-KEM/etc/X11/<cmdline>`
- `/etc/X11/$XORGCONFIG`
- `/tmp/Xorg-KEM/etc/X11/$XORGCONFIG`
- `/etc/X11/xorg.conf-4`
- `/etc/X11/xorg.conf`
- `/etc/xorg.conf`

where `<cmdline>` is specified on the command line at startup

Log file:

    less /var/log/Xorg.0.log

where `0` is the display number.

## X

Get X server version

    sudo X -version

## xhost

View and edit on which users may connect to an X server.

When you start with most desktop environments, they start the host as you.

If you `su another-user`, by default he cannot connect.

View current status:

    xhost

Let any user connect:

    xhost +

Let a single user connect:

    xhost + another-user

## xlsclients

List x clients.

This allows you to see all open windows.

	xlsclients

More detailed info:

	xlsclients -l

## xmodmap

Modify key maps.

For example, to exchange ESC and Caps Lock:

	f=~/.Xmodmap
	echo "! Swap caps lock and escape
    remove Lock = Caps_Lock
    keysym Escape = Caps_Lock
    keysym Caps_Lock = Escape
    add Lock = Caps_Lock
    " >> "$f"
	xmodmap "$f"

To make this happen every time at startup TODO broken?:

	echo "xmodmap \"$f\"
    " >> ~/.xinitrc
	chmod +x ~/.xinitrc

The `~/.xsession` file could also be used depending on system

## xsessionrc

TODO vs `xinitrc`?

## xdotool

Send clicks and manage window properties from sh.

### select window

Before you try to do things to a window, you must say which window you want to act on.

If you don't give any indication, actions occur on the current window.

Every window has a window id.

Act on windows with given id:

    id=
    xdotool search --window "$id" key ctrl+c

Act on windows with given name:

    n=
    xdotool search --name "$n" key ctrl+c

Name is exactly what is shown on window title bar.

### keystrokes

Keystroke types:

- `key`: up and down
- `keydown`: only down
- `keyup`: only up

Send an `a` keystroke to the current window:

    xdotool key a

Send an `a` keystroke and then a `b` keystroke to the current window:

    xdotool key a b

`F2`:

    xdotool key F2

`รก`:

    xdotool key Aacute

`ctrl+l`:

    xdotool key ctrl+l

Sends `a`, `b`, `space`, `c` and `d`:

    xdotool type 'ab cd'

`a`, waits 1 ms, `b`:

    xdotool type --delay 1 'ab'

### sync

Wait for application to start before sending a command to it:

    google-chrome &
    xdotool search --sync --onlyvisible --class "google-chrome"x-terminal-emulator

In this way, you can launch an app and send commands, making sure they will be received!

## keyboard and mouse automation

### AutoKey

High level, GUI interface X11 automation.

## xbacklight

Control screen brightness

Get current lightning level on a scale of 0 to 100:

    xbacklight -get

Set lightning to 80%:

    xbacklight -set 80

## xrandr

Acronym for X Resize, rotate AND Reflect

Gets and sets screen properties such as screen resolution.

    xrandr

Sample output:

    Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1600 x 900, maximum 32767 x 32767
    LVDS1 connected primary 1600x900+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 309mm x 174mm
       1600x900       60.0*+   40.0
       1440x900       59.9
       1360x768       59.8     60.0
       1152x864       60.0
       1024x768       60.0
       800x600        60.3     56.2
       640x480        59.9
    VGA1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
    VIRTUAL1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
    LVDS-2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
    VGA-2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
    DP-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
    DP-2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
    DP-3 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)

TODO understand everything on this output.

This output lists the possible resolutions. Mine are: `1600x900` (current because of the `*`, default because of the `+`).

Change resolution:

    xrandr -s 1360x769

the new resolution must be on the list.

Now:

    xrandr

Outputs:

    1600x900       60.0 +   40.0
    1440x900       59.9
    1360x768       59.8*    60.0
    1152x864       60.0
    1024x768       60.0
    800x600        60.3     56.2
    640x480        59.9

So the asterisk `*` gives the new resolution.

Change to default resolution (the one with the plus sign `+`):

    xrandr -s 0

## PRIMARY selection

## CLIPBOARD

## selection

X support an arbitrary number of selections.

The most important ones are widely implemented by default by most GUI systems:

-   `PRIMARY`: automatically updated to the last selected text.

    It can be pasted with a middle click.

-   `CLIPBOARD`: Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V mechanism.

Each selection contains data completely separate from the others.

Those concepts touched by freedesktop.org: <http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/ClipboardsWiki/>

## xclip

Alternative tool to `xsel`.

## xmodmap

View and modify key mappings.

Get a list of current keymapping state:

    xmodmap -pke > ~/.Xmodmap

Sample output line:

    keycode  24 = q Q q Q adiaeresis Adiaeresis
                  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^
                  1 2 3 4 5          6

1. no modifiers
2. shift
3. mode_switch no shift
4. mode_switch +  shift
5. ?
6. ?
7. ?
8. ?
9. ?

**AltGru** is the mode_switch key.

Up to 8 keysyms bay be attached to each keycode.

However, only the first 4 are commonly used.

## setxkblayout

TODO

## setxkbmap

Swap ESC and CapsLock:

    setxkbmap -option caps:escape

Put this in your `~/.xinitrc`.

## Simple GUI apps

-   `xcalc`: simple scientific calculator
-   `xedit`: text editor
-   `xeyes`: fun X11 test program
-   `xfontsel`: point and click and view how a font looks like
-   `xgc`: X Graphics Demo. A GUI.
-   `xlogo`: a window with an X11 logo
-   `xmag`: magnifying lens
-   `xmessage`: `zenity`'s grandfather
-   `xmore`: `more` for X

-   `xterm`: terminal

### xev

Open a test window and prints X events description to stdout:

    xterm
    xev

Try clicking on the windows, or using your keyboard to see the outputs.

### xinit

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinit backend of startx

#### xinitrc

Sourced in Ubuntu 12.04, but not 14.04.

## startx

<http://askubuntu.com/questions/518454/what-does-startx-command-do/817747#817747>

Script to start an graphical session.

**Don't ever run `sudo startx` on an Ubuntu TTY**!!! It will break your UI. Fix:

    sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop gdm unity
    sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf "/etc/X11/xorg.conf.$(date '+%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S').bak"
