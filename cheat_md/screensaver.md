# Screensaver

Available screensavers at `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/screensaver` as desktop files.

You can execute screensavers under `TryExec` of the desktop entries to see how they look like.

## xdg-screensaver

XDG utils package

Lock screen and activate screensaver:

    xdg-screesaver activate

Seems to reset to the current desktop's default if any is recognized such as gnome-screensaver.

## xscreensaver

Seems to fail is another screensaver such as gnome-screensaver can run.

## gnome-screensaver

Seems that it was rewritten and screensaver change is not implemented as of 07/2013: <http://askubuntu.com/questions/64086/how-can-i-change-or-install-screensavers>
