# JSON

Very popular plain text data exchange format.

Currently specified in by two competing standards:

- IETF RFC4627: <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt> (2006)
- ECMA-404: <http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf>

JSON is based on EcmaScript 3 literal notation.
For this reason it is specially popular amongst the JavaScript community.

It is however *not* a strict subset of JavaScript object only because it can 
contain two characters that JavaScript cannot: <http://timelessrepo.com/json-isnt-a-javascript-subset>
and JSON creator [said](https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/es-discuss/2009-June/009451.html):

> JSON is done. JSON will not be revised.
