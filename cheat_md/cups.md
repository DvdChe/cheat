# CUPS

Cross printer printing protocol.

Also manages print queues.

Client server based. TODO diagram? One server per computer that talks to many printers which are also servers?

Port: 631 TCP and UDP.

You can also visit: <http://localhost:631/> to see a web front-end for CUPS. TODO check: is it standard? Works on Ubuntu 14.04.

## Ink levels

Not possible with CUPS apparently. Consider `ink`.
