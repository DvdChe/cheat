# Xchat

GUI IRC client.

Auto-connect on startup:

-   XChat
-   Network List
-   Select Network
-   Edit
    - Check "Auto connect to this network at startup"
    - Enter the channels to auto-connect to at the improperly named "Favorite channels", which actually auto-connects you, e.g. `#chanelname`.
